description: 'A meningioma is a slow growing tumor attached to the dura mater.
  This is a design pattern for classes representing meningiomas based on their location.
  This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized
  cancer.
  We use the generic ''disease has location'' relation, which generalized over primary
  and secondary sites.

  Examples: [skin meningioma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0004429), [brain
  meningioma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0000642), [choroid plexus meningioma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0003053)
