description: '
  
  Adenomas are neoplasms arising from epithelium. This is a design pattern for classes representing adenomas based on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer. We use the generic `disease has location` relation, which is generalized over primary and secondary sites. 
  Examples: [pituitary gland adenoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0006373),
  [breast adenoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002058)'
