description: '

  Carcinomas are malignant neoplasms arising from epithelial cells.

  This is a Design pattern for classes representing carcinomas based on their location.
  This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized
  cancer.

  We use the generic ''disease has location'' relation, which generalized over primary
  and secondary sites.'
