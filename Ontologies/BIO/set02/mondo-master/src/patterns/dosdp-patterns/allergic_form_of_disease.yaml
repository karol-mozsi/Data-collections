description: '

  An etiological pattern that extends an etiology-generic disease to an allergic form
  (i.e. caused by pathological type I hypersensitivity reaction). The [allergy.yaml](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/allergy.yaml)
  pattern is to refine an existing disease by trigger.

  Examples: [allergic respiratory disease](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0000771),
  [atopic eczema](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0004980), [allergic otitis
  media](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0021202)'
