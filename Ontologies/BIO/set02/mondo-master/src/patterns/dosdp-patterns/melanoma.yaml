description: '
  Melanomas are malignant, usually aggressive tumor composed of atypical, neoplastic melanocytes.
  This is a design pattern for classes representing melanomas based on their location.
  This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized
  cancer.
  We use the generic ''disease has location'' relation, which generalized over primary
  and secondary sites.

  Examples: [cutaneous melanoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0005012), [malignant
  breast melanoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002975), [malignant melanoma
  of the mucosa](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015694) (22 total)'
