description: 'Adenocarcinoma is a common cancer characterized by the presence of malignant glandular cells. This is a design pattern for classes representing adenocarcinomas based on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer. We use the generic disease has location relation, which generalized over primary and secondary sites.

  Examples: [adenocarcinoma of cervix uteri](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0016275), 
  [pituitary adenocarcinoma (disease)](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0017582)'
