description: '

  Sarcomas are malignant neoplasms arising from soft tissue or bone.

  This is a design pattern for classes representing sarcomas based on their location.
  This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized
  sarcma.

  We use the generic ''disease has location'' relation, which generalized over primary
  and secondary sites.'
