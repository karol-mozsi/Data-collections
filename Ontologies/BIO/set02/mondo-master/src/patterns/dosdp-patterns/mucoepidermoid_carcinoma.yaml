description: 'Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are carcinomas morphologically characterized the presence of cuboidal mucous cells, goblet-like mucous cells, squamoid cells, cystic changes, and a fibrotic stromal formation.
  
  This is a design pattern for classes representing mucoepidermoid carcinomas based on their location.
  This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized
  cancer.
  
  We use the generic ''disease has location'' relation, which generalized over primary
  and secondary sites.

  Examples: [cutaneous mucoepidermoid carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0003091),
  [oral cavity mucoepidermoid carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0044964),
