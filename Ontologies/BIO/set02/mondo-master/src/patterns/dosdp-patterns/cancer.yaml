description: '

  Cancers are malignant neoplasms arising from a variety of different cell types.

  This is a design pattern for classes representing cancers based on their location.
  This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized
  cancer.

  We use the generic ''disease has location'' relation, which generalized over primary
  and secondary sites.'
