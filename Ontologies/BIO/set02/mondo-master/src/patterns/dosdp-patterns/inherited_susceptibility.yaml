description: 'This pattern should be used for children of MONDO_0020573''inherited
  disease susceptibility'', including OMIM phenotypic series (OMIMPS) for which the
  subclasses are susceptibilities. Note, this pattern should not have an asserted
  causative gene as logical axiom (and no single causative gene in text definition),
  in those cases, the susceptibility_by_gene pattern should be used instead. The children
  should have asserted causative genes in the text definitions and in the logical
  axioms. This pattern is a superclass of the susceptibility_by_gene pattern.

  Examples: [''microvascular complications of diabetes, susceptibility''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0000065),
  [''epilepsy, idiopathic generalized''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0005579),
  [''aspergillosis, susceptibility to''](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0013562).'
