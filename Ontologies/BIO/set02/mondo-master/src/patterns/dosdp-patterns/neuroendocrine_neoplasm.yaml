description: '

  Note that tumor is typically a synonym for neoplasm, although this can be context
  dependent. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), NCIT uses the nomenclature ''tumor''
  to indicate ''well differentiated, low or intermediate grade tumor''. This can also
  be called carcinoid, see [https://www.cancer.org/cancer/gastrointestinal-carcinoid-tumor/about/what-is-gastrointestinal-carcinoid.html](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/gastrointestinal-carcinoid-tumor/about/what-is-gastrointestinal-carcinoid.html).
  We attempt to spell this out in our labels.

  Examples: [breast neuroendocrine neoplasm](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002485),
  [digestive system neuroendocrine neoplasm](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0024503),
  [ovarian neuroendocrine neoplasm](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0002481)'
