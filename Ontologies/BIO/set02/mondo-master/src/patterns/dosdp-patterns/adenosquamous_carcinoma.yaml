description: 'An adenosquamous carcinoma is a carcinoma composed of malignant glandular cells and malignant squamous cells. This is a design pattern for classes representing adenosquamous carcinomas based on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer. We use the generic ''disease has location'' relation, which generalized over primary and secondary sites.

  Examples: [adenosquamous breast carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0003548), 
  [Bartholin gland adenosquamous carcinoma] (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0003555), 
  [gastric adenosquamous carcinoma](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0006034)'
